# Systems from Scratch ðŸš€

This repository contains a series of projects where I rebuild fundamental developer tools 
(Git, HTTP server, database, shell, etc.) from scratch.  
The goal: **understand how things work under the hood** while improving my programming skills.

## Project Roadmap
- [x] Stage 1: Markdown â†’ HTML Converter
- [ ] Stage 2: Tiny HTTP Server
- [ ] Stage 3: Simple Shell
- [ ] Stage 4: Tiny DNS Resolver
- [ ] Stage 5: Key-Value Database
- [ ] Stage 6: Mini File System
- [ ] Stage 7: Tiny Git
- [ ] Stage 8: Load Balancer
- [ ] Stage 9: Minimal Web Framework

Each project is in its own folder with a `README.md` explaining how it works.
